# study-time-eda
Exploratory data analysis of personal study time using Excel and Tableau to uncover productivity patterns.

## Project Overview
In this project, I tracked all my study sessions for a month during the Fall 2025 semester in Excel, and 
key insights were displayed in Tableau Public.

## Why This Project
This project was motivated by a desire to better understand my own study habits and improve productivity. 
By tracking my study sessions in Excel, I can apply these insights to plan my schedule more effectively 
and work more efficiently.

## Key Questions Explored
Sorted into the following categories.

- **Numerical Outcomes**
  - Do larger blocks of productivity or smaller blocks work better?
  - Does listening to music affect my productivity score?
  - Are short breaks better than long breaks?
  - What is the average productivity score?
- **Categorical Outcomes**
  - When am I most productive? Morning, afternoon, or evening?
  - What locations make me more productive? Does location matter?
  - Does staying in the same location for a long period of time work better?
  - Are certain subjects/tasks more productive than others?
  - Do I consistently perform differently depending on the day of the week?
- **Time-based Trends**
  - Do breaks help boost productivity?
  - How does taking a break affect the next session’s productivity? 

## Data
Datasets:
- ***Raw dataset:*** untouched, original data
- ***Cleaned dataset:*** processed version used for analysis, cleaning steps include:
  - Removed 'Notes' column
  - Standardized categorical variables (e.g., 'With Someone?' and 'Music?' converted from 0/1 to Yes/No)
  - Added 'Duration' column, calculated in minutes
  - Added 'Day of the Week' to analyze patterns by day
  - Added 'In class?' (Yes/No) to account for missing values
  - Handled missing or inconsistent data where necessary
  - Added 'Focus' column to differentiate between the different courses, lectures and club stuff
  - Added 'Break Duration' column to analyze break related things
  - Added 'Time of Day' column, classified by morning, afternoon, and evening

All EDA and visualizations are based on the clean dataset.
