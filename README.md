# study-time-eda
Exploratory data analysis of personal study time using Excel and Tableau to uncover productivity patterns.

## Project Overview
In this project, I tracked all my study sessions for a month during the Fall 2025 semester in Excel, and key insights were displayed in Tableau Public.

## Key Questions Explored
- When am I most productive? Morning, afternoon, or evening?
- Do larger blocks of productivity or smaller blocks work better?
- Do breaks help boost productivity? How does taking a break affect the next session’s productivity? Are short breaks better than long breaks?
- What locations make me more productive? Does location matter? Does staying in the same location for a long period of time work better?
- Are certain subjects/tasks more productive than others?
- Do I consistently perform differently depending on the day of the week?

## Next Steps
My next step is to apply these insights during the Winter 2026 Semester, track my study sessions, and see how these changes improve my productivity.
